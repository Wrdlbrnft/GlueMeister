# GlueMeister 

The smartest, most easy to use dependency injection framework out there!

 - **No slow reflection**: GlueMeister uses compile time code generation to ensure high performance!
 - **If it compiles, it works**: Don't worry about cryptic runtime error messages. Should there be any issue at all it will be detected at compile time and helpful error messages will tell you exactly what you need to do to fix the problem!
 - **Simple and expressive API**: With GlueMeister you don't have to worry about anything. Just mark your dependencies and GlueMeister will take care of everything else!
 - **Quick setup, no configuration required**: Just apply the GlueMeister Gradle Plugin and you are ready to start using it.

This project is currently under active development and **not intended to be used in production**.
